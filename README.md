# Core
Welcome to Core, an advanced moderation bot for your Discord Server. As a server owner myself, I have always found that staff spend a lot of time focusing on punishing the bad users, and not enough time interacting with the community. Core aims to fix that issue with all of our features. From our advanced, all in-app customizability to set-up auto-mod, to our easy to use commands, Core is going to be a breeze to use. Continue reading down below to get more details on what we offer with Core.

**Moderation**

Moderation is arguably the most important part of a server. It helps keep that chat clean and friendly for everyone. We aim to keep things simple, so with Discord's new slash commands, we can do just that. Everything that is required for the command to work is right there, with menus to select which user you want to punish, and even an option to add in proof to add into the moderation log. 

**Security**

Getting into your Discord server should not be the hardest thing around. Some servers require you to do a captcha no matter what the account is. We want the user experiance to be as flawless as possible so with Core, we have a very customizable security system. We created our own advanced checking to make sure that we only give verification to those accounts we believe to be alternate accounts, or even raiders. There is a built in feature when too many people join on the same invite at once, Core will disable the invite so that raiders cannot join.
